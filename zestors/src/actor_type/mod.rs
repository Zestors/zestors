# Overview
The [`ActorType`] of a [`Child<_, A, _>`] or [`Address<A>`] specifies what type of actor it refers
to. Some of the things it specifies are the messages the actor can accept and the type of [`Channel`] used.

An [`ActorType`] can be specified in two different ways:
1) As the [`InboxType`] the actor is spawned with. Some examples of built-in inboxes are the [`Inbox<Protocol>`]
and the [`Halter`]. An actor can choose what inbox it is spawned with, and new inboxes can be created in third-party
crates.
2) As a [`DynActor<dyn T>`](struct@DynActor) where `T` is one of the [`dyn_types`], usually written with [`DynActor!`].
The actor is not specified by it's inbox, but instead by the messages it [`Accepts`].

# `DynActor!` macro
Writing [`DynActor`](struct@DynActor) types can become complicated, nstead of writing and remembering these types,
use the [`DynActor!`] macro to specify the [`ActorType`]:
- `DynActor!()` = `DynActor<dyn AcceptsNone>`
- `DynActor!(u32)` = `DynActor<dyn AcceptsOne<u32>>`
- `DynActor!(u32, u64)` = `DynActor<dyn AcceptsTwo<u32, u64>>`
- etc.

# Transforming actor-types
Any [`ActorRef`] that implements [`Transformable`] allows it's [`ActorType`] to be transformed into and
from a dynamic one. This allows references to different inbox-types to be transformed into ones of the same
actor-type.

[`Transformable`] is implemented for an [`Address<A>`] and [`Child<_, A, _>`], which allows them to be transformed
into an `Address<T>` and `Child<_, T, _>` as long as [`A: TransformInto<T>`](TransformInto).
Some examples with the default inbox-types:
- A [`Halter`] can be transformed into a `DynActor!()`.
- An [`Inbox<P>`] can be transformed into a `DynActor!(M1 .. Mn)` as long as `P` implements
[`FromPayload<M>`] for `M in [M1 .. Mn]`.
- A [`DynActor!(M1 .. Mn)`](DynActor!) can be transformed into a `DynActor!(T1 .. Tm)` as long
as [`T1 .. Tn`] âŠ† [`M1 .. Mm`].

For these examples transformation can be done with [`Transformable::transform_into`] with transformations
checked at compile-time. Transformations can also be checked at run-time (or not at all)
with [`Transformable::try_transform_into`] and [`Transformable::transform_unchecked_into`].

A [`DynActor`](struct@DynActor) can be downcast into the original [`InboxType`] with [`Transformable::downcast`].

All addresses that can be transformed implement [`IntoAddress`] and all children [`IntoChild`].

# Example
```
use futures::stream::StreamExt;
use zestors::{actor_reference::ExitError, messaging::RecvError, prelude::*};

// Let's start by creating a simple event-loop for our actor.
async fn my_actor(mut inbox: Inbox<()>) -> &'static str {
    // This actor receives a single event only.
    match inbox.recv().await {
        Err(RecvError::ClosedAndEmpty) => "Closed and empty",
        Err(RecvError::Halted) => "Halt properly handled",
        Ok(_msg) => {
            panic!(r"\('o')/ This actor panics upon receiving a message!")
        }
    }
}

// We will now spawn the actor a bunch of times, but do different things with it to
// show of different functionalities.
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Halting an actor:
    let (child, address) = spawn(my_actor);
    child.halt();
    assert!(matches!(child.await, Ok("Halt properly handled")));
    assert_eq!(address.await, ());

    // Shutting down an actor:
    let (mut child, address) = spawn(my_actor);
    child.shutdown();
    assert!(matches!(child.await, Ok("Halt properly handled")));
    assert_eq!(address.await, ());

    // Aborting an actor:
    let (mut child, address) = spawn(my_actor);
    child.abort();
    assert!(matches!(child.await, Err(ExitError::Abort)));
    assert_eq!(address.await, ());

    // Closing the inbox:
    let (child, address) = spawn(my_actor);
    child.close();
    assert!(matches!(child.await, Ok("Closed and empty")));
    assert_eq!(address.await, ());

    // Making it panic by sending a message:
    let (child, address) = spawn(my_actor);
    child.send(()).await.unwrap();
    assert!(matches!(child.await, Err(ExitError::Panic(_))));
    assert_eq!(address.await, ());

    // Dropping the child:
    let (child, address) = spawn(my_actor);
    drop(child);
    assert_eq!(address.await, ());

    // Halting a child-pool:
    let (child_pool, address) = spawn_many(0..10, |_, inbox| async move { my_actor(inbox).await });
    address.halt();
    child_pool
        .for_each(|process_exit| async move {
            assert!(matches!(process_exit, Ok("Halt properly handled")));
        })
        .await;
    assert_eq!(address.await, ());

    // Shutting down a child-pool
    let (mut child_pool, address) =
        spawn_many(0..10, |_, inbox| async move { my_actor(inbox).await });
    child_pool
        .shutdown()
        .for_each(|process_exit| async move {
            assert!(matches!(process_exit, Ok("Halt properly handled")));
        })
        .await;
    assert_eq!(address.await, ());
