# Zestors
Currently, work is being done on rebuilding Zestors from scratch. 
Once GAT's get stabilized, I will try to get out a first proper release.

In the meantime, it's possible to use version v0.0.1. Be prepared for (almost) everything to change with version 0.1.0!

Version 0.1.0 should then run entirely on stable rust.
