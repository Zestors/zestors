# Zestors
A fast and flexible actor-framework for building fault-tolerant Rust applications.

Zestors is thoroughly documented at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/zestors) with guides covering most aspects of the system and a quick-start to get up and running. Certain parts of the system have been tested extensively, but there are (very likely) some bugs due to it still being young.

The core parts of zestors have been stable for quite some time and will not change very much anymore, however from the `handler` module and beyond, big changes are expected! I have been working for a long time and would like to get it out there and see what people think instead of working on it forever behind the scenes. If you have any feedback or encounter an bug or unclear usage then I would appreciate an issue for this.
